Size measurements of biomas burning aerosol over West Africa
Agining of biomas burning aerosol over West Africa


# Introduction
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP, as described
Bloggs et al 2004. Smith et al (1998) conducted several 
studies in this region, but continental-scale 
measurements had not previously been made.

Add third paper in intro.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa using John's 
mod

# Figures 
Figures only go at the end in a draft paper.

# Methodology 
We compared simulations from John's model (Smith et al 2005)
with our measurements. 

# Results
Our simulations and measurements indicate that particle 
growth is dominated by coagulation. 

# Conclusions 
We have have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging
process. Nonetheless, answers remain unanswered.
Therefore, it is recommeneded we receive more funding.
