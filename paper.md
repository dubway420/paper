Measurements of biomas burning aerosol over West Africa

# Introduction
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP, as described
Bloggs et al 2004. Smith et al (1998) conducted several 
studies in this region, but continental-scale 
measurements had not previously been made.
